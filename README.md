### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yousof Algburi, a self-taught software developer. I started programming in 2014 and was hooked very quickly. I've been teaching myself the skills necessary to build quality software ever since. I'm very passionate about creating full stack applications and I'm always eager to learn new things.
