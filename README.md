### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yousof Algburi, a self-taught software engineer. I started programming in 2014 and was hooked very quickly. I've been teaching myself all the skills necessary to build quality software ever since. I'm very passioniate about creating full stack applications and I'm always eager to learn new things.
